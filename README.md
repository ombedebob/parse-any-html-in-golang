# parse-any-html-in-golang

I this repo I show how to parse any html templates and information 
to a golang backend. The server used is the normal
http.ListenAndServe() but instead or incase of security purposes
http.ListenAndServeTLS() can be used to add in that layerof security
and provide the https instead of http

In this I implement a simple data structure to show how 
to work with the users input in more meaningful ways.
its a simple log in that matches the user's username 
and password  to a simple database and returns information
to the user
